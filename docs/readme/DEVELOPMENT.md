## 🏗️ Project Structure

```
src/
├── application/      # Controllers, middleware, validators
├── domain/          # Business logic and entities
├── infrastructure/  # External services, database, logging
├── presentation/    # Routes, views, public assets
└── cloud/          # Parse Server cloud functions
```

## 🛠️ Code Style

- **ESLint**: Enforced code quality and security rules
- **Prettier**: Consistent code formatting
- **Pre-commit hooks**: Automatic validation before commits

```bash
# Format code before committing
yarn format && yarn lint
```

## 🔒 Security Development

AmexingWeb follows **PCI DSS 4.0** secure development practices:

- ✅ All input must be validated and sanitized
- ✅ No hardcoded secrets or credentials
- ✅ Security middleware cannot be bypassed
- ✅ Audit logging for all security events

See [SECURE_DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE.md](../SECURE_DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE.md) for detailed security requirements.
